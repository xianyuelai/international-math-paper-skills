### Deep Rollback Example

```
[Cycle 4] Working on Core.lean:89 - `main_theorem`...
Stuck after 3 attempts. Escalating to deep mode (--deep=stuck)...

Creating snapshot (--deep-snapshot=stash)...
Snapshot captured: <snapshot-id>

Deep phase 1: Extracting helper lemma to Helpers.lean
  Compile: ✓ (sorry count: 1 → 1, no new diagnostics)
Deep phase 2: Filling sorry using helper
  Compile: ✗ — sorry count increased (1 → 3)

Regression detected (--deep-regression-gate=strict):
  Sorry count: 1 → 3 (+2 regression)
  Rolling back to <snapshot-id>...
  Rollback: ✓
  Marking stuck: "deep: regression — sorry count increased from 1 to 3"

Stuck handoff:
- Deep abort reason: regression (sorry count +2)
- Strategy attempted: helper extraction to Helpers.lean
- LSP queries: lean_leanfinder("convergence bound"), lean_local_search("tendsto")
- Recommendation: try alternative approach or manual guidance

Running stuck review...

Note: if rollback itself fails, the cycle stops immediately —
no checkpoint is created, and the sorry is marked stuck with
"deep: rollback failed".
```

**Edge case — new diagnostic errors (sorry count unchanged):**

```
Deep phase 1: Refactoring Filter usage in Core.lean
  Compile: sorry count 1 → 1, but 2 new type mismatch errors

Regression detected (--deep-regression-gate=strict):
  New diagnostics: 2 errors not present in pre-deep baseline
  Rolling back to <snapshot-id>...
  Marking stuck: "deep: regression — new errors"
```

## disprove

### Basic Usage

```
/lean4:disprove Foo.lean:42                       # File + line (sorry/declaration site)
/lean4:disprove MyNs.SubNs.myThm                  # Qualified theorem name
/lean4:disprove Foo.lean:42 --max-cycles=5
/lean4:disprove Foo.lean:42 --commit=never
```

`/lean4:disprove` is always interactive — every cycle's Plan phase
presents Step 0 (Knowledge Search Menu), Step 1 (Method Menu), and
Step 2 (Config Menu) — three dynamic menus the cycling LLM proposes
for user review and approval.

### Cycle 1 — decide-cascade Win Example

A simple bounded universal: Step 0 runs quickly with the default Lean +
local items (no cited findings), the dynamic Step 1 menu ranks
`decide-cascade` at rank 1 (because `Target Profile.decidable=yes` and
no decide-family success has been recorded yet); the cycle's candidate
pre-screens clean in Phase 2 and is certified by the Phase 3 gate.

     small literals + Inhabited — useful if decide times out.
     Cost (~wall-clock): ~5s
  3. [family: enumerate]                     [medium]

Step 2 — Configure decide-cascade:

### Cycle 1 mine miss → cycle 2 enumerate widen + certify

A widening pass over an infinite ℕ-quantifier: cycle 1's `mine` exhausts
without a witness; cycle 2's dynamic Step 1 menu **promotes** `enumerate`
based on the accumulated `(mine, exhausted-no-witness)` evidence plus a
Step 0 web finding that cites `n=40`, and the cycle certifies.

    verified_via = webfetch:…wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_for_primes
    confidence = high
  Lean / local: 0 hits.

Step 1 — Search method for cycle 1:
  1. (Recommended) [family: mine]   [cheap]
     Try small literals first — cheap exhaustion; the web finding hints
     at a witness around n=40, past the default literal set, so mine
     likely misses but lets cycle 2 specialize enumerate around that point.
     Cost (~wall-clock): ~5s
  2. [family: enumerate]             [medium]
     Iterate Nat in [5, 64) with atom=decide — direct route to the
     web-cited witness; cycle 1 could also start here.
     Cost (~wall-clock): ~1m
  3. [family: tactics]               [medium]

Step 2 — Configure mine:
  1. (Recommended) candidates=10, include_inhabited=true
     Standard mining; web finding's n=40 is past the literal set, so
     this likely misses — expect cycle 2 to widen.
     Cost (~wall-clock): ~5s
     Coverage:           list: 10 named candidates (literals + Inhabited)
  2. candidates=50, include_inhabited=true
     Aggressive; still misses if literals max at ~30.

=== Cycle 2 — Plan ===

(Step 0 skipped — Step 1 did not pick `knowledge search`.)

Step 1 — Search method for cycle 2:
  1. (Recommended) [family: enumerate]  [medium]
     Iterate Nat in [5, 64) — the (mine, candidates=10) pair is in the
     failed evidence so it's excluded from the top 3; the web finding
     citing n=40 falls inside this window.
     Cost (~wall-clock): ~30s
  2. [family: plausible]                 [medium]
     200 random Nat samples — broader but probabilistic.
     Cost (~wall-clock): ~30s
  3. [family: tactics]                   [medium]
     residual cascade — last resort if enumerate near-misses.
     Cost (~wall-clock): ~15s

  custom method

> [Enter — accept rank 1]

Step 2 — Configure enumerate:
  1. (Recommended) range_type=both, range_start=5, range_end=64, atom_tactic=decide
     Hits the web finding's n=40 within the window; decide as atom.
     Cost (~wall-clock): ~30s
     Coverage:           window: 59/∞ over Nat (covers [5, 64))
  2. range_type=range, range_start=5, range_end=128, atom_tactic=decide
     Wider window; ~2× cost.
     Cost (~wall-clock): ~1m
     Coverage:           window: 123/∞ over Nat (covers [5, 128))
  3. range_type=range, range_start=5, range_end=64, atom_tactic=norm_num
     Same window, norm_num atom for arithmetic predicates.

### Three-cycle INCONCLUSIVE — verify-known-cex with WebFetch failure

A stubborn target: decide isn't applicable; enumerate's window misses;
plausible's sample budget exhausts. Cycle 2's Step 0 surfaces a web
finding that LOOKS like a known counterexample, but `WebFetch` fails to
verify the cited URL, so the candidate is **dropped rather than elevated**
to `[verify-known-cex]` — the cycle falls back through the regular method
ranking.

Resolving target... lean_goal → ∀ n : Nat, p n

    decidable      : no            ← `p` lacks DecidablePred instance
    candidate_grid : [0, 64) default window

=== Cycle 1 — Plan ===
  Step 0 — visit 1/3: ran default Lean + local items; 0 cited findings.
  Step 1 — LLM proposes: [decide-cascade] rank 1 (~1s, atomic — but
           must-appear-in-top-3 invariant is OFF because decidable=no;
           the user picks it anyway to confirm), [mine] rank 2
           (~5s, list:10), [enumerate] rank 3 (~30s, window:59/∞).
  Step 2 — decide-cascade with native_decide=off (Cost ~1s, atomic).

=== Cycle 1 — Work ===  decide / native_decide / norm_num / omega — all
                        report no DecidablePred instance. Outcome:
                        no-candidate.
=== Cycle 1 — Review ===  no-candidate; Time: actual ~0.5s (estimated ~1s); Step 0 visits 1/3
=== Cycle 1 — Accumulate ===
  Appended: (decide-cascade, {native_decide:false}, no-candidate)

Cycle 1 complete (no-candidate).
  Next cycle's Step 1 preview: [enumerate] range=[5,64), atom=decide
- [continue] / [stop]
> continue (at Step 1, pick `knowledge search` to override preview)

=== Cycle 2 — Plan ===
  Step 0 — visit 2/3 (entered via Step 1 `knowledge search`):
    Items: all 8 selected (web items included). Approve > yes.
    Web finding: "p fails at n=128" — source_url=example.com/preprint.pdf
    WebFetch on example.com/preprint.pdf: 404 (cited URL is dead).
    Finding dropped (verification failed; not elevated to [verify-known-cex]).
    Lean / local hits: 0.
  Step 1 — LLM proposes: no [verify-known-cex] entry (verification failed).
           [enumerate] rank 1 (~30s, window:59/∞ — widening from default);
           [plausible] rank 2 (~30s, sampled:200); [tactics] rank 3 (~15s).
  Step 2 — enumerate with range=[5,200), atom=decide (Cost ~2m,
           window:195/∞ — user widened past the LLM's range_end=64
           seed via custom-config).

=== Cycle 2 — Work ===  No counterexample in [0, 200);
                        outcome = exhausted-no-witness.
=== Cycle 2 — Review ===  exhausted-no-witness; Time: actual ~2m (estimated ~2m); Step 0 visits 2/3
=== Cycle 2 — Accumulate ===
  Appended: (enumerate, {range_type:range, range_start:5, range_end:200,
             atom_tactic:decide}, exhausted-no-witness)

> continue

=== Cycle 3 — Plan ===
  Step 0 — skipped (Step 1 did not pick `knowledge search`).
  Step 1 — LLM proposes: [plausible] rank 1 (~75s, sampled:500) — last
           remaining family with a widening lever; (enumerate,
           range_end:200) is in failed evidence so any (enumerate,
           ≤200) variant is excluded from top 3.
  Step 2 — plausible with samples=500, seed=auto (Cost ~75s, sampled:500).

=== Cycle 3 — Work ===  No counterexample after 500 samples;
                        outcome = exhausted-no-witness.
=== Cycle 3 — Review ===  exhausted-no-witness; Time: actual ~70s (estimated ~75s)
=== Cycle 3 — Accumulate ===
  Appended: (plausible, {samples:500, seed:auto}, exhausted-no-witness).
  Stuck check: no non-failed (family, config) pair remains for top 3 —
                cycle marked STUCK.

(--max-cycles=3 reached; budget exhausted before the second stuck cycle.)

## Lean4 Review Report
**Scope:** Core.lean (file — target default)

### Build Status
✓ Core.lean compiles successfully

### Sorry Audit (1 remaining)
- Core.lean:89 - `convergence_bound`
  Goal: `∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, |f n - L| < ε`
  Suggestion: Search mathlib for `Metric.tendsto_atTop`

### Axiom Status
✓ Standard axioms only

### Style Notes
- Line 45: Consider `simp only [add_comm, mul_comm]` instead of `simp [*]`
- Line 78: Proof is 38 lines - consider extracting helper lemma

### Golfing Opportunities
- Line 23: `apply f; exact h` → `exact f h` (directness win)
- Line 56: `ext x; simp` - verify if `simp` alone suffices

### Complexity Summary
- Theorems in file: 8
- Average proof: 15 lines
- Longest: `convergence_bound` (38 lines)

### Recommendations
1. Fill `convergence_bound` sorry - likely in mathlib
2. Extract helper from long proof at line 78
3. Tighten `simp` calls for faster compilation
```

[Autoprove detects no progress on Core.lean:89]

Claude: No progress on Core.lean:89 after 3 attempts. Running stuck review...

## Stuck Review — Core.lean:89

**Top 3 blockers:**
1. Missing lemma for tendsto_atTop → search Mathlib.Topology.Order
2. Need MeasurableSpace instance → add `haveI` before apply
3. Goal has implicit coercion issue → try `convert` instead of `exact`

**Recommended:** Search tendsto variants first.

Review complete. Proposed plan:
1. Search Mathlib.Topology.Order for tendsto_atTop variants
2. Add `haveI : MeasurableSpace β := inferInstance` before apply
3. If exact fails, try `convert` with explicit type annotation

Proceed with this plan? [yes / no / skip]

### Counterexample Discovery Example

> **Legacy / prove-engine flow.** This illustrates the shared prove-engine
> falsification-artifact path, which may also emit a `T_salvaged` sibling. The
> dedicated `/lean4:disprove` command does **not** do this in v1: salvage is
> locked off (`--negation-policy=counterexample-only`), so disprove emits only
> `T_counterexample`, never `T_salvaged`. Salvage modes are future work — see the
> [disprove section](#disprove) for the current contract.

See [cycle-engine.md](cycle-engine.md#falsification-artifacts) for artifact templates.

```
Claude: Working on Core.lean:42 - `naive_bound`...

Goal: ⊢ ∀ n : Fin 5, n.val < 3

Preflight falsification (Fin 5 is decidable)...
Trying decide... Found counterexample: n = 3

## Counterexample Found

Statement `naive_bound` is false.
Witness: `⟨3, by decide⟩` with `¬ (3 < 3)`

Creating counterexample lemma...
```lean
/-- Counterexample to naive_bound -/
theorem naive_bound_counterexample : ∃ n : Fin 5, ¬ (n.val < 3) := by
  exact ⟨3, by decide⟩
```

Create salvage lemma? [yes/no]

User: yes

Claude: What correction makes it true?
- Option A: Restrict domain to `Fin 3` (all values < 3)
- Option B: Weaken bound to `n.val < 5` (trivially true for `Fin 5`)

User: A

Creating salvage:
```lean
/-- Salvaged version of naive_bound: restrict to Fin 3 -/
theorem naive_bound_salvaged : ∀ n : Fin 3, n.val < 3 := by
  intro n; exact n.isLt
```

## File Verification

### Three-Tier Verification Ladder

Use the lightest tool that answers the question:

| Tier | Tool | When | Speed |
|------|------|------|-------|
| Per-edit | `lean_diagnostic_messages(file)` | After every edit | Sub-second |
| File compile | `lake env lean <path/to/File.lean>` | File-level gate, import checks | Seconds |
| Project gate | `lake build` | Checkpoint, final gate, `/lean4:checkpoint` | Minutes |

Run `lake env lean` from the Lean project root; pass repo-relative file paths.

### Anti-Pattern: `lake build` with File Arguments

```
# ✗ Wrong — lake build does not accept file path arguments
lake build InfinitaryLogic/Scott/Sentence.lean
→ error: unknown target 'InfinitaryLogic/Scott/Sentence.lean'

# ✓ Correct — use lake env lean for single-file compilation
lake env lean InfinitaryLogic/Scott/Sentence.lean
→ (compiles single file with lake environment)
```

### Typical Verification Flow

```
1. Edit proof
2. lean_diagnostic_messages(file)    # immediate feedback
3. Fix any issues
4. lake env lean path/to/File.lean   # file-level gate (from project root)
5. Continue editing...
6. lake build                        # project gate at checkpoint only
```

## refactor

### Basic Usage

```
User: /lean4:refactor ForwardEuler/Main.lean
```

```markdown
## Refactor Plan — ForwardEuler/Main.lean

### Strategy Improvements
1. `continuousOn_eulerPath` (line 104): case-splitting on endpoints
   → Use `ContinuousOn.congr` + `Set.EqOn` (saves ~20 lines)

2. `hasDerivWithinAt_eulerPath` (line 149): manual derivative via unfolding
   → Use `HasDerivAt` chain + `congr_of_eventuallyEq` (saves ~5 lines)

### Helper Extraction
1. Floor computation from Ico membership — appears 4x (lines 89, 119, 155, 198)
   → Extract `floor_eq_of_mem_Ico`

### Estimated Impact
- Lines before: 310
- Lines after: ~245
- Helpers extracted: 1
- Mathlib lemmas newly applied: 3

Apply batch 1 (3 changes)? [yes / skip / stop]

## Compactness in Mathlib

**Core definition:** `IsCompact` in `Mathlib.Topology.Defs.Basic`
```lean
def IsCompact (s : Set α) : Prop :=
  ∀ ⦃f : Filter α⦄, NeBot f → f ≤ 𝓟 s →
    ∃ a ∈ s, ClusterPt a f
```

**Key lemmas:**
| Lemma | Location |
|-------|----------|
| `IsCompact.isClosed` | Mathlib.Topology.Separation.Basic |
| `IsCompact.isBounded` | Mathlib.Topology.MetricSpace.Bounded |
| `isCompact_iff_finite_subcover` | Mathlib.Topology.Defs.Basic |

**Hierarchy:** TopologicalSpace → CompactSpace → IsCompact (for subsets)

Starting Natural Numbers Game — Track: nng-like (8 levels)

## Level 1: Zero + n = n

Prove that `0 + n = n` for all natural numbers `n`.

```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  sorry
```

Hint available if you need it. Type your proof:

User: induction n with
| zero => rfl
| succ n ih => simp [Nat.add_succ, ih]

Claude: Verifying via lean_goal + lean_multi_attempt...
lean_diagnostic_messages → clean
✓ Level 1 complete! [verified]

## Level 2: Succ (a + b) = a + Succ b

```lean
theorem succ_add (a b : Nat) : Nat.succ a + b = Nat.succ (a + b) := by
  sorry
```

### Paper as Source — Math Intent

````
User: /lean4:learn --source ./papers/stone-weierstrass.pdf

Claude: Reading PDF... extracting key results.

[Intent: math (inferred from PDF) | Presentation: informal]

## Stone–Weierstrass: Main Results [unverified]

1. **Theorem 1 (Real):** If A is a subalgebra of C(X, ℝ) that separates points and contains constants, then A is dense in C(X, ℝ).
2. **Theorem 2 (Complex):** The analogous result for self-adjoint subalgebras of C(X, ℂ).
3. **Corollary:** Every continuous function on [a,b] is a uniform limit of polynomials (Weierstrass).

Which result would you like to explore?

User: 1

Claude: **Theorem 1** says that polynomial-like function algebras are "enough" to approximate any continuous function, provided two conditions...
